<h1>FULLWAVE</h1>

<p>Full-wavefield tomography, or full-wavefield inversion (FWI) as it is otherwise known, is a technique for seismic depth imaging, for velocity-model building, and for obtaining models of physical properties in the sub-surface at high spatial resolution. The technique has recently risen to prominence after it has been demonstrated to produce spectacular improvements in PSDM beneath heterogeneous overburden.</p>

<h2>Fullwave Game Changer</h2>

<p>The FULLWAVE research consortium that was among the first to demonstrate full-wavefield tomography in 3D on field datasets. The group have developed computer codes for 3D FWI using acoustic, viscoacoustic, TTI anisotropic, and elastic wave equations, and are extending these techniques to undertake joint seismic-CSEM inversion.</p>

<p>Here FULLWAVE consortium members can access details of upcoming meetings, download presentations and the software. If are interested in becoming a consortium member then please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
