<h1>FULLWAVE</h1>

<p>Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a computational technique for analysing seismic data that can build high-resolution high-fidelity three-dimensional quantitative models of physical properties in the subsurface.  FWI is beginning to be widely used within the oil and gas industry, and it has potential to image the Earth on a wide variety of scales. The technique has recently risen to prominence after it has been demonstrated to produce spectacular improvements in pre-stack depth-migrated seismic images beneath heterogeneous overburden.</p>

<h2>Anisotropic 3D full-waveform inversion</h2>

<p>Computer codes that can perform 3D anisotropic acoustic and elastic full-waveform inversion on large field datasets have been developed at Imperial College London. These codes are designed to run on large parallel clusters of multi-core compute nodes.</p>

<p>Commercial access to these programs is available through membership of the <em>FULLWAVE Game Changer research consortium</em>. Their application to academic problems can be arranged through collaboration with Imperial College London.</p>

<h2>Fullwave Game Changer</h2>

<p>The FULLWAVE research consortium was among the first to demonstrate practical full-waveform inversion in 3D on field datasets. These early codes were developed in the frequency domain.</p>

<p>The FULLWAVE III research consortium developed 3D TTI anisotropic FWI codes that operate in the time domain. This code has been commercialised within a number of companies.</p>

<p>The current FULLWAVE Game Changer research consortium has developed a fully anisotropic 3D elastic FWI code, and is developing FWI techniques that do not require low frequencies, accurate starting models, or very-large source-receiver offsets.</p>
