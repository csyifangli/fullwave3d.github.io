FWI is widely used within the oil and gas industry and elsewhere across the earth sciences, and it has potential to image the Earth on a wide variety of scales. The technique has recently risen to prominence after it has been demonstrated to produce spectacular improvements in pre-stack depth-migrated seismic images beneath heterogeneous overburden.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://fullwave3d.github.io/images/res-slice.gif\" alt=\"Reservoir cross section\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\r\n\r\n[Warner et al (2013)_ Anisotropic 3D full-waveform inversion_, **Geophysics**, **volume 78**, pages R59â€“R80](https://github.com/fullwave3d/publications/blob/master/geo2012-0338.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##Anisotropic 3D full-waveform inversion\r\n\r\nComputer codes that can perform 3D anisotropic acoustic and elastic full-waveform inversion on large field datasets have been developed at Imperial College London. These codes are designed to run on large parallel clusters of multi-core compute nodes.\r\n\r\nCommercial access to these programs is available through membership of the **FULLWAVE** research consortium. Their application to academic problems can be arranged through collaboration with Imperial College London.\r\n\r\n* [Contact us](contacts.html)\r\n\r\n##Fullwave Research Consortium\r\n\r\nThe FULLWAVE research consortium was initiated in 2002 to develop practical three-dimensional FWI computer codes for application to field seismic datasets.  We were first able to demonstrate this in 2007, winning the Bonarelli Award for a paper presented at EAGE in Rome 2008 entitled \"Efficient and Effective 3D Wavefield Tomography\".  \r\n\r\nThese early codes were developed in the frequency domain, in part because frequency-domain codes had proven to be far superior in performance in earlier two-dimensional applications.  This advantage however is not easily replicated in three dimensions.  Consequently, from 2008, the FULLWAVE III research consortium developed 3D TTI anisotropic FWI codes operating in the time domain. This code has been commercialised within a number of companies.\r\n\r\nThe current phase of the research consortium, FULLWAVE Game Changer Phase II, began on 1 January 2015.  The Game Changer consortium has developed a fully anisotropic 3D elastic FWI code, and is developing FWI techniques that do not require low frequencies, accurate starting models, or large source-receiver offsets.\r\n\r\nThe links below give **consortium members** access to confidential software, documentation, presentations and details of past and upcoming meetings.\r\n\r\n* [Software](downloads)\r\n* [Presentations](2014Feb)\r\n* [Publications](abstracts)\r\n* [Meetings](meetings)\r\n* [Other documentation](documents)\r\n\r\nConsortium members can sign up for access to the website [here](access.html).",
