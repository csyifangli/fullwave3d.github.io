  "body": "# Full-waveform seismic inversion\r\n\r\nFull-waveform inversion (FWI) is a computational technique for analysing seismic data that can build high-resolution high-fidelity three-dimensional quantitative models of physical properties in the subsurface.  FWI is widely used within the oil and gas industry and elsewhere across the earth sciences, and it has potential to image the Earth on a wide variety of scales. The technique has recently risen to prominence after it has been demonstrated to produce spectacular improvements in pre-stack depth-migrated seismic images beneath heterogeneous overburden.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://fullwave3d.github.io/images/res-slice.gif\" alt=\"Reservoir cross section\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\r\n\r\n[Warner et al (2013) *Anisotropic 3D full-waveform inversion*, Geophysics, 78, R59â€“R80](https://github.com/fullwave3d/publications/blob/master/geo2012-0338.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##Anisotropic 3D full-waveform inversion\r\n\r\nComputer codes that can perform 3D anisotropic acoustic and elastic full-waveform inversion on large field datasets have been developed at Imperial College London.
